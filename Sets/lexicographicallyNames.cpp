/*
    Cherry's birthday is coming this month! She wants to plan a birthday party and is 
    preparing an invite list with her friend Aashi, She asks Aashi to tell her names to add to the list.

    Aashi is a random guy and keeps coming up with names of people randomly to add to
    the invite list, even if the name is already on the list! Cherry hates redundancy and
    hence, enlists the names only once.

    Find the final invite-list, that contains names without any repitition

    INPUT:
    First line of each test contains an integer N, the number of name that Aashi pops
    up with

    OUTPUT:
    Output the final invite-list with each name in a new line. The names in the final invite list are
    sorted lexicographically.
